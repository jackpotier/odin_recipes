# odin_recipes
The 'Recipes' Project from Foundations on The Odin Project
This project is designed to test basic HTML skills learnt in the HTML Foundations section of The Odin Project.
The goal is to create a basic recipe website, which will consist of a main index page which will have links to a few recipes.
